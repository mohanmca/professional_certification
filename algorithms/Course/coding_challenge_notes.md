## Checklist during preparation

1 Work through the problems by hand
1 Work through the coding by hand
1 Talk to your serf (it helps during interview as well)
1 If you don't find the explanation, find alternative explanation online


## What skill is required to tackle coding interview

* Ability to think methodically
* Develop mental heuristics for how to tackle and test unfamiliar problems.
* Algorithmic Complexity

## Checklist during code challenge

* Read question 3 times
* Produce sample input and outputs
* Use assertions and exceptions liberally - fail fast
* Use whiteboard properly (don't start in middle or right-side of the board)

## List of principles/points we should aware about.

* Prefer to use immutable (i+1 instead of i++)
* Pay attention to length-1 and zero (-1 index issues)
* Read the question minimum of 3 times
* Write sample input and output to understand the question
* > instead of >= or < instead of <=
* of-by-one error is the most occuring error
* When problem has symmetrical structure, ensure you apply on all the symetry (logic on left should be equated with logic on right)
* In some problems (such as kd-tree), ensure latest subtle results are being used (current nearest)
* Cost of algorithm = F(compare) + G(swaps) + H(array-access) + K (Extra memory required)
* List all the steps that deduce some facts in a given input
