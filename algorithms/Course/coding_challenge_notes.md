## List of principles/points we should aware about.

* Prefer to use immutable (i+1 instead of i++)
* Pay attention to length-1 and zero (-1 index issues)
* Read the question minimum of 3 times
* Write sample input and output to understand the question
* > instead of >= or < instead of <=
* of-by-one error is the most occuring error
* When problem has symmetrical structure, ensure you apply on all the symetry (logic on left should be equated with logic on right)
* In some problems (such as kd-tree), ensure latest subtle results are being used (current nearest)
