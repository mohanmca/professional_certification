## Notes from course

* Algorithm - solving problems for large inputs. large - trillion
* Efficient procedures for large scale problems.
* Scalability is important factor
* Real implementation in python for MIT 6.006 course
* 8 modules with problems and classic datastructure


## Peek finder

* Theta(n), Lower bound
* BigO(n), upper bound
* T(1) - Work algorithm does on input of size n
* O(log(2)n) vs O(n), for n = million 0.1 seconds vs 13 seconds


## Computation Model

* Python list sort using "Comparision Sort" - O(|n| log n)
* len(list) - In python is constant time (it internally stores the length)


## Why Sorting?

* Finding person phone number
* Song or movie catalog that are sorted is easy to search
* Find median
* Binary search can be applied on sorted elements
* Data compression depends on sorting


## Sorting notes

* Insertion sort - why does it take worst-case when sorting reverse sorted elements
* Comparistion is always more expensive than swap (always trade-off can choose swaps if possible)
* Insertion sort  - Theta(n.log-n) for comparision, but still Theta(n.n) for swaps
